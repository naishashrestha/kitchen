			Step 1
<hr>
<p> Pots de Creme is a thick and rich pudding that’s baked and served chilled. This one uses earl gray tea in addition to chocolate to give it a more fragrant touch. I served it with a Cointreau ( an orange- flavored liqueur ) whipped cream>

			Step 2
<hr>
<p> Preheat your oven to 325 Fahrenheit with a rack in the center. Heat cream in a pan over medium with the tea bags fully submerged until the cream is almost simmering. Try to keep them moving, so the tea can infuse the cream. Press and remove the tea bags before adding the chocolate and stirring until fully blended
